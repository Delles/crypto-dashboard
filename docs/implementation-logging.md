# Implementation Logging

This document provides a log of the implementation details for the Personal Crypto Dashboard project. It serves as a reference for new developers and a record of the architectural and technical decisions made during development.

## Project Initialization

The project was set up as a standard Vite + React application with TypeScript. The following key technologies were chosen:

-   **Framework:** React 19
-   **Build Tool:** Vite
-   **Language:** TypeScript
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4
-   **UI Components:** shadcn/ui

## UI Component Library: shadcn/ui

`shadcn/ui` is used for building the user interface. It is not a traditional component library but rather a collection of reusable components that can be copied into the project.

### Adding New Components

To add new components from `shadcn/ui`, use the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
```

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard React application structure, with a few key conventions:

```

-   **`src/components/ui`**: This directory contains the base UI components from `shadcn/ui`.
-   **`src/components/dashboard`**: This directory contains the components that are specific to the crypto dashboard feature. It now includes `PlatformCard.tsx` and a refactored `AssetCard.tsx`.
-   **`src/lib/utils.ts`**: This file contains utility functions, including the `cn` helper from `shadcn/ui`.
-   **`src/lib/dummy-data.ts`**: This new file contains the TypeScript interfaces and mock data for the dashboard.

## Initial Implementation Steps

1.  **Initialized `shadcn/ui`**: The project was configured to use `shadcn/ui` by creating the `components.json` file.
2.  **Added Core Components**: The `card`, `button`, and `table` components from `shadcn/ui` were added to the project.
3.  **Cleaned Boilerplate**: The default Vite and React boilerplate code was removed from `App.tsx` and `App.css`.
4.  **Created Dashboard Layout**: The main dashboard layout was created in `App.tsx`, including a header and a main content area.
5.  **Built Feature Components**: The following feature-specific components were created with mock data:
    -   `DashboardOverview`
    -   `AssetList`
    -   `AssetCard`
    -   `HistoryView`
6.  **Organized Components**: The feature components were extracted into their own files within the `src/components/dashboard` directory for better organization and reusability.
7.  **Defined Data Structures and Mock Data**: Created `src/lib/dummy-data.ts` to define `Asset`, `Platform`, and `Holding` interfaces and populated it with a `dummyAssets` array to simulate a realistic portfolio.
8.  **Made Overview Dynamic**: Refactored `DashboardOverview.tsx` to accept `totalValue` and `percentageChange` props, removing hardcoded values.
9.  **Added Accordion Component**: Added the `accordion` component from `shadcn/ui` to enable expandable card views.
10. **Created Expandable Asset Cards**: Refactored `AssetCard.tsx` to use the `Accordion` component. It now accepts an `Asset` object and displays aggregated data with an expandable table of detailed holdings.
11. **Created Platform Cards**: Created the new `PlatformCard.tsx` component to display data grouped by platform, also featuring an expandable view for asset details.
12. **Added Tabs Component**: Added the `tabs` component from `shadcn/ui` to prepare for view switching.
13. **Created Main Dashboard Component**: Implemented `Dashboard.tsx` to act as the central hub for the UI. It manages the view state ("asset" vs. "platform"), processes data from `dummy-data.ts` to calculate totals and group data, and renders the appropriate components.
14. **Implemented View Toggling**: Used the `Tabs` component within `Dashboard.tsx` to create a toggle that allows users to switch between "Group by Asset" and "Group by Platform" views.
15. **Streamlined App Layout**: Updated `App.tsx` to render the single, unified `Dashboard` component, simplifying the main layout.
16. **Removed Obsolete Component**: Deleted `AssetList.tsx` as its functionality was superseded by the logic within `Dashboard.tsx`.
17. **Added Charting Library**: Installed `recharts` and its type definitions to enable data visualization.
18. **Created Analytics Component**: Built the `Analytics.tsx` component to display portfolio insights. It includes a line chart for historical portfolio value and a pie chart for asset allocation.
19. **Integrated Analytics**: Added the `Analytics` component to `Dashboard.tsx`, placing it below the main card views to provide a complete overview.
20. **Removed History View**: Deleted the old `HistoryView.tsx` file, as its purpose is now fulfilled by the new line chart in the `Analytics` component.
21. **Implemented Theme Switching**:
    -   Installed `next-themes` to handle theme state management.
    -   Created a `ThemeProvider` and wrapped the application in `main.tsx`.
    -   Added a `ModeToggle` component to the header in `App.tsx` for switching between light, dark, and system themes.
    -   Refactored the theme context and hooks into separate files (`src/contexts`, `src/hooks`) to fix linter errors related to Vite's fast refresh.
22. **Modernized UI and Color Palette**:
    -   Updated the color palette in `src/index.css` with a more vibrant, modern `oklch`-based theme for both light and dark modes.
    -   Refined the main application layout in `App.tsx`, adding a structured header and container for better spacing and visual hierarchy.
    -   Enhanced user feedback by adding hover effects to `AssetCard.tsx` and `PlatformCard.tsx`.
    -   Improved button clarity by adding icons to the "Add Asset" and "Add Platform" buttons in `Dashboard.tsx`.
23. **Implemented Add Platform Modal**:
    -   Added `dialog`, `select`, `input`, and `label` components from `shadcn/ui`.
    -   Created `AddPlatformModal.tsx` to allow users to select and add new platforms ("Binance" or "MultiversX").
    -   The modal includes conditional forms to capture the necessary credentials for each platform type.
24. **Integrated Local Storage for Platforms**:
    -   Created `src/lib/store.ts` to abstract `localStorage` logic for saving and retrieving platform data.
    -   Updated `Dashboard.tsx` to open the modal and use the store to persist new platforms.
    -   The "Group by Platform" view now displays the list of platforms saved in `localStorage`.
25. **Refactored Platform Components**:
    -   Updated the `Platform` interface in `src/lib/dummy-data.ts` to be more flexible.
    -   Simplified `PlatformCard.tsx` to display only the platform name and total value, preparing for future data fetching.
26. **Implemented MultiversX Data Fetching**:
    -   Created `src/lib/multiversx-api.ts` to handle API requests to the MultiversX network.
    -   The service fetches EGLD balance and all ESDT tokens for a given wallet address.
    -   Integrated the API service into `Dashboard.tsx` to fetch data for all stored MultiversX wallets on component load.
    -   Updated `PlatformCard.tsx` to display the fetched tokens and their quantities using an accordion and a table.
27. **Enhanced MultiversX Data Handling**:
    -   Updated the MultiversX API service to fetch token metadata, including price and USD value.
    -   Implemented filtering to exclude dust or spam tokens with a value of less than $1.
    -   Updated `PlatformCard.tsx` to display the price and total value for each token, and the aggregated total value for the platform.
28. **Implemented Binance Data Fetching**:
    -   Installed the `binance` library to interact with the Binance API.
    -   Added `crypto-browserify` and `stream-browserify` and configured `tsconfig.json` for browser compatibility.
    -   Created `src/lib/binance-api.ts` to handle fetching account balances and ticker prices.
    -   The service calculates the USD value of each asset and filters out dust accounts.
    -   Integrated the Binance API service into `Dashboard.tsx` to fetch data for all stored Binance accounts on component load.
    -   The "Group by Platform" view now displays fetched data for both MultiversX and Binance platforms.
